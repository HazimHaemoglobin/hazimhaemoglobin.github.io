                    Dr. Ian Mauro comes to UWinnipeg via Mount Allison University where he held a Canada Research Chair in Human Dimensions of Environmental Change. Mauro is a pioneer of multi-media methodologies, scholarship and education. His interdisciplinary work weaves the social and ecological sciences together recognizing the important synergies between scientific and indigenous knowledge.
                    Originally from Winnipeg, Mauro is returning home to be the newest addition to UWinnipeg’s geography department. His ongoing research in the Arctic, Atlantic and Prairie regions of Canada endeavours to help us better listen to the language of the land, and offers strategies for healthy human interaction with the biosphere.
                    Mauro is known to use participatory video to collect digital stories to help communicate and conserve local and indigenous knowledge. This allows people who live on the land to tell their own stories, in their own language, and within the landscapes where their knowledge has been generated. He was awarded an “Apple Distinguished Educator” award for his approach in 2011.

                    Dr. Lingle’s research focuses on the evolution of prey defenses as it affects their biology, psychology, and ecology. A focal point in her research is animal cooperation witnessed predominantly in defense against a predatory threat. Most of Dr. Lingle’s work has been conducted on the prairie grasslands of western Canada. The prairies possess one of the largest proportions of at-risk plants and animals of any ecosystem in North America. Dr. Lingle uses an understanding of prey behaviour, seasonal vulnerability, and unintentional provisioning of predators through human activities to identify the reasons that prey on the prairie are at particular risk. She collaborates with others to increase awareness of the plight of the prairie and to address the problems that currently face many prey species living on the prairie.

                    Dr. Danny Blair’s research interests and activities are largely concerned with the detection and characterization of climate variability and change on the Canadian prairies. He is interested in the effects that large-scale teleconnections (i.e., ENSO, PNA, PDO, AO) have on the prairie climate and is very concerned about the impacts that global warming is having, and will have, on the region.  
                    He is a professor in the Department of Geography at The University of Winnipeg and was named the PARC-Manitoba Hydro Climate Change Research Professor in 2004. Most recently, he became the Director of the Climate Studies Institute at The University of Winnipeg’s Global College. Blair is also an adjunct professor at the University of Manitoba, Co-Chair of Manitoba’s Climate Change Connection, and a frequent contributor to newspaper, radio, and television stories about climate variability and global warming.

                <div style="display:none" id="julia-bio">
                    <p><strong>Yulia Burakova</strong><br>
                        My name is Yulia Burakova but I prefer to go by Julia. I was born and raised in Russia, in Western Siberia. This is why Winnipeg's weather is very much like home. At age 16, I decided to pursue my dream to study abroad. So, I got accepted by a college in USA and in 2005 I moved there. This is where my foreign journey truly began! It was a tough first year of me learning English and adopting to a new culture and education environment. All went very well and in 2007, I successfully graduated from the college with an honors Associate's degree of Science. 
                        After that, I thought to myself " What is next?". I knew I did not want to stay in USA as I wanted to explore more countries and learn French. And there you go, I moved to Canada, to Manitoba, to Winnipeg! It was an interesting change. I could speak English in USA and I could speak English here, in Canada,  but what a huge difference it was between two countries, which are just separated by a boarder! Wow!
                        In Canada, I graduated from The University of Winnipeg with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. Right thereafter, I got a job offer to work for the administration office of The English Language Program at The University of Winnipeg. This is what I have been doing with 2012. I truly enjoy working with international students, who come to our university to learn English and pursue their degree. We are all so different from each other, we have different cultures, language, traditions, but yet- we all have a dream!
                        When I initially saw that The University of Winnipeg will be hosting the first TEDx Event, I got super excited. TED Talks is a great chance for people around the world to spread ideas worth of sharing.  I messaged the admin person for the event and let them know that I would like to be involved in TEDx The University of Winnipeg. Why I did that? Because I believe this is an amazing chance for outstanding people to present and share their ideas and projects with us. Every speaker at the event will be presenting their own masterpiece work with you! Isn't that great?!
                        I know many international students and even my friends, whose English is not their first language and who told me that they use TED Talks for improving their English and for learning more about the world through unique ideas. 
                        I will be a part of the team for putting this event to life! Making it happen so to say! I am very excited about spreading the word and encouraging people to be involved!
