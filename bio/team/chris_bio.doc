Hey!

I'm Chris, and I am thrilled to be part of this amazing tedXperience.

I am a 25 year old Computer Science major who enjoys swimming, cycling, and reading. Oh, and tinkering with the back-end of web frameworks :)

My goal as part of our team is to develop a secure website that is functional across Chrome, Firefox, iPhone, Android, Opera, & other browsers, providing interactivity that will leave you thirsting for our TEDx talk this September. I am also broadcasting our TEDx talk LIVE so those without tickets can see the exciting discussion as it happens.

Please join me in my utmost excitement for our very own TEDx talk!

Chris
