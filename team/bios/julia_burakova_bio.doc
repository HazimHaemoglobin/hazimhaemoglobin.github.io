My name is Yulia Burakova but I prefer to go by Julia. I was born and raised in Russia, in Western Siberia. This is why Winnipeg's weather is very much like home. At age 16, I decided to pursue my dream to study abroad. So, I got accepted by a college in USA and in 2005 I moved there. This is where my foreign journey truly began! It was a tough first year of me learning English and adopting to a new culture and education environment. All went very well and in 2007, I successfully graduated from the college with an honors Associate's degree of Science. 
After that, I thought to myself " What is next?". I knew I did not want to stay in USA as I wanted to explore more countries and learn French. And there you go, I moved to Canada, to Manitoba, to Winnipeg! It was an interesting change. I could speak English in USA and I could speak English here, in Canada,  but what a huge difference it was between two countries, which are just separated by a boarder! Wow!
In Canada, I graduated from The University of Winnipeg with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. Right thereafter, I got a job offer to work for the administration office of The English Language Program at The University of Winnipeg. This is what I have been doing with 2012. I truly enjoy working with international students, who come to our university to learn English and pursue their degree. We are all so different from each other, we have different cultures, language, traditions, but yet- we all have a dream!
When I initially saw that The University of Winnipeg will be hosting the first TEDx Event, I got super excited. TED Talks is a great chance for people around the world to spread ideas worth of sharing.  I messaged the admin person for the event and let them know that I would like to be involved in TEDx The University of Winnipeg. Why I did that? Because I believe this is an amazing chance for outstanding people to present and share their ideas and projects with us. Every speaker at the event will be presenting their own masterpiece work with you! Isn't that great?!
I know many international students and even my friends, whose English is not their first language and who told me that they use TED Talks for improving their English and for learning more about the world through unique ideas. 
I will be a part of the team for putting this event to life! Making it happen so to say! I am very excited about spreading the word and encouraging people to be involved!
